## Getting Started
If you want to contribute or just want to run on your local machine, follow these steps:
- Clone this repository
- Start develop with command `npm start`
- Open the index.html at `public/index.html`
- Use `npm build` to build, the results are same, just the webpack mode changed to production

Note: You can open both with server and directly
